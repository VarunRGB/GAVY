# SLIET Mentorship Platform

## Overview
This project is a web-based mentorship platform developed for the Web Development Competition under the Pixel Wizard challenge. The platform aims to connect students from SLIET with faculty members from the Computer Science department who act as mentors, offering academic and career guidance.

The platform allows students to book one-on-one sessions with faculty mentors based on their availability. It enhances communication between students and faculty, fostering strong connections within the SLIET community.

## Features

### 1. Automated Booking System
- **Mentor Availability**: Faculty mentors provide specific time slots for mentorship sessions.
- **Booking Status**: Slots that are already booked will be marked as “booked,” while available slots can be selected by students for new bookings.
- **Session Booking**: Students can book sessions directly through the platform. Faculty mentors will receive notifications or reminders about their upcoming bookings.

### 2. Faculty Profiles from the Computer Science Department
- The platform includes detailed profiles of Computer Science faculty mentors, showcasing:
  - Their experience and expertise.
  - Areas of academic or career guidance they offer.
  - Available time slots for mentorship.
  
### 3. Simple Communication System
- **Notification System**: Basic notifications (via email or through the platform) remind students and mentors about upcoming sessions.
- **Chat Feature**: A simple chat feature enables students and mentors to exchange important information prior to the session.

## Expected Outcome
The mentorship platform aims to strengthen the student-faculty relationship at SLIET, providing continuous support and fostering the personal and professional growth of students. Faculty members will be able to engage more actively with students, enhancing their overall learning experience.

## Technical Requirements
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** were used to build the platform.
- No external libraries, frameworks (e.g., React, Bootstrap), or backend services are used, in accordance with the competition rules.
